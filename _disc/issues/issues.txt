# Render Widget Overflow for long names (Corona Virus) in Appbar

# In "Swipe left to see more", Pages added to PageView even after swiping left. Can swipe indefinitely left now.

# News Website and inShorts news don't match (sometimes)

# After changing language, some texts are not updating (e.g., in app bar, on Discover screen, the "My Feeds" text) (sometimes)

# Janking swipe (vertical in feeds and horizontal in My Feeds -> <News Site>)

# Old Feeds coming before new feeds (e.g., Corona virus feeds)
